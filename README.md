# Harness Skills

Claude Code skills for the [Harness.io](https://harness.io) CI/CD platform. Generate pipeline YAML, manage resources, debug failures, analyze costs, and more -- all from natural language.

## Prerequisites

- [Harness MCP v2 Server](https://github.com/thisrohangupta/harness-mcp-v2) -- required for MCP-powered skills. Most skills in this repo depend on this server for Harness API access.

## Setup

### Claude Code

Clone the repo and run Claude Code from the project directory. Skills are automatically discovered from `CLAUDE.md` and `skills/*/SKILL.md`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harness/harness-skills.git
cd harness-skills
claude
```

To add the Harness MCP server, configure it in your Claude Code settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "harness-mcp-v2": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "harness-mcp-v2"],
      "env": {
        "HARNESS_API_KEY": "<your-api-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Invoke skills by name:

```
/create-pipeline
Create a CI pipeline for a Node.js app that builds, runs tests,
and pushes a Docker image to ECR
```

### Cursor

1. Clone the repo into your project or as a reference workspace:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harness/harness-skills.git
```

2. Add the skills as Cursor rules. Copy `CLAUDE.md` into your project's `.cursor/rules/harness.md`, or reference the skills directory in Cursor's settings:

```
Settings → Rules → Project Rules → Add Rule
```

Paste the contents of `CLAUDE.md` as a project rule, or point Cursor to individual `SKILL.md` files as context.

3. Configure the Harness MCP server in Cursor (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "harness-mcp-v2": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "harness-mcp-v2"],
      "env": {
        "HARNESS_API_KEY": "<your-api-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

4. Reference skills in your prompts by including the relevant `SKILL.md` as context or by asking Cursor to follow the instructions in the file:

```
@harness-skills/skills/create-pipeline/SKILL.md
Create a CI pipeline for my Go service
```

### OpenAI Codex

1. Clone the repo into your working directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harness/harness-skills.git
```

2. Add `CLAUDE.md` as a system instruction file. Codex reads instruction files from the project root -- rename or copy it:

```bash
cp harness-skills/CLAUDE.md ./AGENTS.md
```

3. Configure the Harness MCP server in your Codex MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "harness-mcp-v2": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "harness-mcp-v2"],
      "env": {
        "HARNESS_API_KEY": "<your-api-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

4. Reference individual skill files as context when prompting:

```
Using the instructions in harness-skills/skills/debug-pipeline/SKILL.md,
diagnose why my deploy pipeline failed
```

### GitHub Copilot

1. Clone the repo into your project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/harness/harness-skills.git
```

2. Add skills as Copilot custom instructions. Copy `CLAUDE.md` to your repo's `.github/copilot-instructions.md`:

```bash
cp harness-skills/CLAUDE.md .github/copilot-instructions.md
```

Copilot automatically reads this file as project-level context in both GitHub.com and VS Code.

3. For VS Code, configure the Harness MCP server in your workspace settings (`.vscode/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "harness-mcp-v2": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "harness-mcp-v2"],
      "env": {
        "HARNESS_API_KEY": "<your-api-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

4. Reference skill files in Copilot Chat using `#file`:

```
#file:harness-skills/skills/create-pipeline/SKILL.md
Create a CI pipeline for my Python service
```

5. For GitHub Copilot on GitHub.com, attach skill files as context in Copilot Chat or add them as knowledge base references in your Copilot organization settings.

### Windsurf / Other AI Editors

The skills in this repo are plain Markdown files with YAML frontmatter. They work with any AI coding tool that supports:

1. **System instructions** -- Use `CLAUDE.md` as project-level context
2. **MCP servers** -- Connect the [Harness MCP v2 server](https://github.com/thisrohangupta/harness-mcp-v2) for API access
3. **File context** -- Reference individual `skills/*/SKILL.md` files in prompts
